As a workaround we recommend either uninstalling and reinstalling the application or `rm ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/Docker.qcow2`, then restarting.

Unfortunately containers and images will need to be rebuilt.  I apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.",

Try the following steps:
- stop Docker for Mac
- delete the file `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.docker.vmnetd`
- start Docker for Mac

Hopefully this will (re-)install the networking helper process properly.

If this still doesn't work, please try the following steps:

```
sudo cp $(mdfind Docker.app)/Contents/Resources/com.docker.vmnetd.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.docker.vmnetd.plist
sudo chmod 600 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.docker.vmnetd.plist
sudo launchctl load -Fw /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.docker.vmnetd.plist
```

and start Docker for Mac.",
